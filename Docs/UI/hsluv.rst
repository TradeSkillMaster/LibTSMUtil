HSLuv
=====

The ``HSLuv`` module provides an implementation of the `HSLuv`_ color space and APIs to convert
between RGB and HSLuv. The implementation is heavily inspired by the `HSLuv-lua`_ project. These
APIs are not intended to be used directly, but rather are used internally by the ``Color`` class.
