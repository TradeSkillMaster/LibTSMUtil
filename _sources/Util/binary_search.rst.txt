BinarySearch
============

The ``BinarySearch`` module provides an implementation of the binary search algorithm for quickly
finding an element within a sorted sequence. The ``BinarySearch.Table`` API is provided for easily
searching through a table, as well as a ``BinarySearch.Raw`` API for searching an arbitrary data
sequence via a specified function.
